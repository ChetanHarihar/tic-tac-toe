# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game! This is a simple Python command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns to mark 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 grid.

### How to Play

1. Run the Python script `tic_tac_toe.py`.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose your marker ('X' or 'O').
3. The game will randomly determine who goes first.
4. Players take turns to choose an empty position on the board by entering a number from 1 to 9. The positions are mapped to the number pad on your keyboard, like this:

 7 | 8 | 9
-----------
 4 | 5 | 6
-----------
 1 | 2 | 3
-----------

5. The first player to get three of their markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
6. If all positions on the board are filled, the game ends in a tie.
7. You can choose to replay the game as many times as you like.
